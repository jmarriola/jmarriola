### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jill and I am a postdoctoral scholar at The Pennsylvania State University in the [Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science](met.psu.edu). My PhD in Marine Sciences is from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](marine.unc.edu) where I studied spatial and temporal variability in carbon sequestration and burial in coastal wetland sediments along the US Gulf of Mexico and the Yellow River delta in China. I am interested in all things carbon, wetlands, and estuaries. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently part of an NSF funded project looking at improving estimations of ecosystem metabolism in estuaries.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of R. I just built my first R package and am working on putting it into my first Shiny app!  
- ðŸ“« You can reach me [here](mailto:jva5648@psu.edu)
