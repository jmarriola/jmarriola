### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jill (*she/her/hers*) and I am the Staff Scientist for the [Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring](dickinson.edu/allarm) at Dickinson College. I have a PhD in Marine Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am interested in all things carbon, wetlands, streams, and estuaries. 

- Iâ€™m a forever learner of R (it's a steep hill to climb!).
