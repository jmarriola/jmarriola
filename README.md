### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jill (*she/her/hers*) and I am a postdoctoral scholar at [The Pennsylvania State University](met.psu.edu) in the Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science. My PhD is in Marine Sciences from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](marine.unc.edu) where I studied spatial and temporal variability in carbon sequestration and burial in coastal wetland sediments along the US Gulf of Mexico and the Yellow River delta in China. I am interested in all things carbon, wetlands, and estuaries. 

- I'm currently part of an NSF funded project looking at improving estimations of ecosystem metabolism in estuaries.  
- Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of R. I just built my first R package and Shiny app!
